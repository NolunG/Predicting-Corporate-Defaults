# Predicting-Corporate-Defaults-Using-Machine-Learning

Trying to predict whether a company will default or not in upcoming year using machine learning model. Ideally, 
there should be multiple in depth fundamental and statistical ways to predict this. This is more of a gneral diagnostic approach where after flagging by this algorithm, 
a manual in depth research can be carried by an analyst. 

This can work as a flag to analyze credit defaults, and have an early flagging system for corporate defaults.
